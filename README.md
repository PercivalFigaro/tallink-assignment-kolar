## About

This is the test assignment for the Front-End Developer role at Tallink. I used React with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind and Jest for unit tests. Next.js was chosen, because it is the official recommendation in the [React docs](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project), even though most of its functionality is not used. Even though there are few components, I set up the tests, utilities and global types like I would set them up in a small to mid sized project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS Version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webpage.

To run the Jest test suite:

```bash
npm test
```

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
